SHORTHAND: [final_version](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/-airline-assessment-and-popularity/index.html)<br>

## Project 1st Stage<br>
At the beginning to make a project the following items are structured.

Part1: [1st Stage of final Project](/final_project_TakafumiSudare.md)<br>

At Part1, the following information was planned and sketched.<br>
1. The project outline (Please refer to "Outline")
2. A high-level summary of your project (Please refer to "Project Story")
3. A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story (Please refer to "Project Story" and 1st/2nd picture of Story Sketch)
4. A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.(Please refer to "Information", "Project Story" and "Project Method and Medium")
5. A link to the publicly-accessible data you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. (Please refer to "Information")
6. A few paragraphs summarizing your approach to the project (Please refer to "Project Story")<br>

## Project 2nd Stage<br>
At the 2nd Stage, I was focusing on making a high-level sketch that shows the overall project. And I also made storyboards which tells my project in detail. That storyboards must be accommodated with the high-level sketch. Both works should be in sync. And User research also needs to be addresed. <br>
The following is the link that I was working at Part2.

Part2: [Iink to the User Research](/User_Research.md)<br>
Part2: [Iink to the Source Data for making Graph](/dataSourceLink.md)<br>

At Part2, the following works were addressed.<br>
1. Sketches and storyboards(1st Steps) (Please refer to "User Reserch" on "Iink to the User Research")
2. Wireframes  (Please refer to "Wireframe" on "Iink to the User Research")
3. Findings after user research  (Plear refer to "2nd Stage of final Project"link)
4. Update Wireframe and storyboards based on user research (Plear refer to "2nd Stage of final Project"link)

In part2, "Call to action" needs to be clear. Take away was originally set as "Call to action". But more concrete information needs to be put. And rather than just visualization, If airline ranking is focused, choosing criteria should be asked at user research. (It is not sufficient) That needs to be taken care of.
