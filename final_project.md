# Final Project<br>

## Final published version

SHORTHAND: [final_version](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/airline-assessment-and-popularity/index.html)<br>

## Project 1st Stage<br>
In the beginning, to make a project the following items are structured.

Part1: [1st Stage of final Project](/final_project_TakafumiSudare.md)<br>

At Part1, the following information was planned and sketched.<br>
1. The project outline (Please refer to "Outline")
2. A high-level summary of your project (Please refer to "Project Story")
3. A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story (Please refer to "Project Story" and 1st/2nd picture of Story Sketch)
4. A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.(Please refer to "Information", "Project Story" and "Project Method and Medium")
5. A link to the publicly-accessible data you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. (Please refer to "Information")
6. A few paragraphs summarizing your approach to the project (Please refer to "Project Story")<br>

## Project 2nd Stage<br>
At the 2nd Stage, I was focusing on making a high-level sketch that shows the overall project. And I also made storyboards that tells my project in detail. That storyboards must be accommodated with the high-level sketch. Both works should be in sync. And User research also needs to be addressed.<br>
The following is the link that I was working at Part2.

At Part2, the following works were addressed.<br>
1. Sketches and storyboards(1st Steps) (Please refer to "User Research" on "Link to the User Research")
2. Wireframes (Please refer to "Wireframe" on "Link to the User Research")
3. Findings after user research (Please refer to "2nd Stage of final Project" link)
4. Update Wireframe and storyboards based on user research (Please refer to "2nd Stage of final Project" link)

In part2, "Call to action" needs to be clear. Take away was originally set as "Call to action". But more concrete information needs to be put. And rather than just visualization, If airline ranking is focused, choosing criteria should be asked at user research. (It is not sufficient) That needs to be taken care of.<br>

## Project 3rd Stage<br>
Toward finalizing my final project, The following is a **summary** that I needed to adjust from the design and observation point of view.

1. Graph(Customer Ranking Graph)<br>
   Originally, I was planning to use the graph which was made at the tableau. But at several reviews in the class, I thought it might be a little bit difficult to understand by first sight. So I changed the approach to make a ranking graph by myself. I used several companies logos for the audience to understand what I want to show easily. But logos needed to be check if they can be utilized. I had to check one by one if it can be used. Some of them were not allowed to be used. So I changed those from logo to just wording.<br>
2. Airfare comparison graph<br>
    I tried several times to show a nicer comparison sheet via tableau. But it could not be made well. So I designed the graph images and visualized it by myself. It took much time to design.<br>
3. From the Observation perspective,  I used Scrollmation to show the customer ranking graph. Originally, I was planning to use Text Over Media. But it was difficult to add an explanation on the same sheet. It was not easy to see the explanation due to the colorful back image which is ranking graph. Meanwhile, if explanation is separated from the graph, it was difficult to understand the explanation without graph image. So I changed that. Due to that, the graph became a little bit a small size than what I expected.<br>
4. There were so many citations for my project. To get vast and several pieces of information to make a concrete explanation, there are so many citations I had to put on SHORTHAND. From a design point of view, it was difficult how could I put links and citations nicely.<br>

The following is SHORTHAND that I published. (The final_version link is same as the link on top)<br>

SHORTHAND: [final_version](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/airline-assessment-and-popularity/index.html)<br>

All links and citations were added and checked if they are allowed to be used.
In terms of citations, I added some comments about which portions need to be checked.
I ensured I have permission to use imagery and other assets. I was referring to the guide that the professor mentioned.<br>

**Audience:**<br>
The target audience is classmate and persons who are planning to travel using airlines. Based on that, I carefully put the sample merits from Southwest and Alaska Airlines. In that paragraph, it is very easy for people who are planning to trip by using a certain airline to compare what is the differences between what I am showing as unique services and what they are planning to use as usual. This can lead them to re-consider what airline they are going to use for their trip. And at the final paragraph, I emphasized to re-consider and check current airline and try to use another airline which has many unique services which attract you. This is a big "call action" to them.
