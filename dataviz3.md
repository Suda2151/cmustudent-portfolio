# Assignment 3&4 <br><br><br>

## Step1 : find a data visualization<br><br>

Based on the instruction, I used the following data for my visualization.<br>

[Data visualization Link](https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/media_root/document/Research_Fact-Sheet_US-Travel-and-Tourism-Overview.pdf)<br>

There is no visualization, so it is hard to understand what this matrix info wants to show us. <br>
By picking up some of the information from the matrix sheet, I will make data visualization with storied.<br><br>

## Step2 : Critique the data visualization<br><br>

This has been already assessed on 1/28/2020.<br><br>

## Stap3 : Wireframe a solution<br><br>

The wireframe sketch is below.<br> 
I made 3 patterns to visualize the information.<br>
My point is showing the growth of travelers from growth and number perspective.<br>

## Step4 : Test the solution<br><br>

I also did memo on the above notebook. The following is review's comment.<br>

### person1<br>
Q1: Can you tell me what you think this is?<br>
--> A1: Not sure what this is. There is no information about these sketch.<br><br>

Q2: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?<br>
--> A2: I can not imagine. At No2, it seems some information about Domestic and International.<br><br>

Q3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?<br>
--> A3: At No.1, the rage is narrow. And, at No.2, it is difficult to compare between Domestic and International. And it is difficult to see million and growth rates in one sheet. And, at No.3, you need to put value.<br>
        Overall, information is not enough to understand. that needs to be enhanced.<br><br>

Q4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?<br>
--> A4: Unfortunatelly, no idea.<br><br>

Q5: Is there anything you would change or do differently?<br>
--> A5: At first, will update tile and explanation. International and Domestic had better be separated.<br><br>

### person2<br>
Q1: Can you tell me what you think this is?<br>
--> A1: Not sure what this is. But it seems it relates to trip by checking the point on the notebook.<br><br>

Q2: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?<br>
--> A2: It seems that some trend is showing. Both domestic and International are the same growth and have almost same value.<br><br>

Q3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?<br>
--> A3: Overall, it is a little bit hard to understand what the graph shows. Especially, No2 has several pieces of information into one sheet. It is difficult to understand. And I thought Domestic and International have the same value. But actually it was not the same. There are many sketches, I did only one.<br><br>

Q4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?<br>
--> A4: Travelers who want to go trip. And travel company.<br><br>

Q5: Is there anything you would change or do differently?<br>
--> A5: At least, the graph of growth rate and the number of travelers had better be separated.<br><br>

##  Lessons learned approach<br><br>
1. Need to describe the graph title clearly
2. Need to describe some explanation.
3. Need to male 2 graphs if I need to show growth and popularity.
4. Need to put values.<br><br>


## Step5 : Build your solution<br><br>
1. Original Source is below link.<br>
[Data Source Link](https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/media_root/document/Research_Fact-Sheet_US-Travel-and-Tourism-Overview.pdf)<br>
* Reason for selecting this matrix sheet<br>
This information is very useful for travel agencies to make a strategic plan to earn much more profit. But It is difficult to understand what point the matrix sheet shows by first sight. There is no visualization. By visualizing information, it must be easy to know what the rends are from a travel perspective. That's the reason why I pick up this sample.<br><br>

2. Process to make graphs<br>
Based on the critique method, at first, it should have visualization for this information. And I paid attention to the number of travelers who do a trip in the U.S.  For travelers, there are two types of travelers as a whole. One is domestic travelers who live in the U.S. and travel in the U.S. The other is international travelers who live in overseas and travel to the U.S.<br>
By comparing this 2 information, travel agencies can know the trend if the needs of a trip in the U.S. are increasing of not. And It is easy to know how many people in the U.S/from overseas go trip in the U.S. By knowing both, the travel agencies know how big the potential market for this. <br>
Meanwhile, not only the number but also the growth rate needs to be known toward making a good trip plan.  By checking the rate, agencies know that which(Domestic/International) is more growing. By checking the number of travelers, it is obvious that domestic travelers are the majority and make a profit. But by seeing the rate, the growth rate of international is higher than the rate of domestic in a certain year, it means that the international has a potential growing power than domestic in a certain year. Agencies can more focus on the trip plans for international people to make more profit. And by seeing the trend, the growth rate of international has stopped since 2016. By visualizing, that can be seen, and agencies can check the cause and countermeasures. <br>
In addition, the government can know that tax income has been raised by travelers. It might be a benefit for agencies to have a financial support depending on trip plan.<br><br>

By having feedbacks from colleagues, I modified the following update.<br>
1). Updated the title and axis explanation for audience to understand easily.<br>
2). I separated a graph. One focuses on number of travelers comparing domestic and international. The other focuses on the growing rate which implies which is a higher rate, and what happened if there are some spikes.<br>
3). Adopted stacked bar chart to show how big/small the number of domestic/international is.<br> 


## Total number of Travelers from Domestic v.s. International in U.S.<br>
The following graph shows how many people in the U.S or overseas(international) travels in the U.S.<br>
Basically, both are increasing year by year except international in 2016. By visualizing that, people can know whether the travel industry is growing or not.<br><br>

## Percentage of expenditure growth from previous year<br>
The following graph shows how high each domestic and international travel business growth is. Orange colored bars shows domestic(Thick:Expenditure, Thin:Tax revenue), and Blue colored shows international(Thick:Expenditure, Thin:tax revenue). The "Expenditure" means a profit from travel industry point of view. <br>
Basically, both are growing every year. By 2015, the growth of international is higher than domestic. Since 2016, growth of international is flat This seems to be because of regime change according to several news papers. <br><br>
