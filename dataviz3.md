# Assignment 3&4 </br></br></br>

## Step1 : find a data visualization</br></br>

Based on the instruction, I used the following data for my visualization.</br>

[Data visualization Link](https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/media_root/document/Research_Fact-Sheet_US-Travel-and-Tourism-Overview.pdf)</br>

There is no visualization, so it is hard to understand what this matrix info wants to show us. </br>
By picking up some of the information from the matrix sheet, I will make data visualization with storied.</br></br>

## Step2 : Critique the data visualization</br></br>

This has been already assessed on 1/28/2020.</br></br>

## Stap3 : Wireframe a solution</br></br>

The wireframe sketch is below.</br> 
I made 3 patterns to visualize the information.</br>
My point is showing the growth of travelers from growth and number perspective.</br>

## Step4 : Test the solution</br></br>

I also did memo on the above notebook. The following is review's comment.<br>

### person1</br>
Q1: Can you tell me what you think this is?</br>
--> A1: Not sure what this is. There is no information about these sketch.</br></br>

Q2: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?</br>
--> A2: I can not imagine. At No2, it seems some information about Domestic and International.</br></br>

Q3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</br>
--> A3: At No.1, the rage is narrow. And, at No.2, it is difficult to compare between Domestic and International. And it is difficult to see million and growth rates in one sheet. And, at No.3, you need to put value.</br>
        Overall, information is not enough to understand. that needs to be enhanced.</br></br>

Q4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</br>
--> A4: Unfortunatelly, no idea.</br></br>

Q5: Is there anything you would change or do differently?</br>
--> A5: At first, will update tile and explanation. International and Domestic had better be separated.</br></br>

### person2</br>
Q1: Can you tell me what you think this is?</br>
--> A1: Not sure what this is. But it seems it relates to trip by checking the point on the notebook.</br></br>

Q2: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?</br>
--> A2: It seems that some trend is showing. Both domestic and International are the same growth and have almost same value.</br></br>

Q3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</br>
--> A3: Overall, it is a little bit hard to understand what the graph shows. Especially, No2 has several pieces of information into one sheet. It is difficult to understand. And I thought Domestic and International have the same value. But actually it was not the same. There are many sketches, I did only one.</br></br>

Q4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</br>
--> A4: Travelers who want to go trip. And travel company.</br></br>

Q5: Is there anything you would change or do differently?</br>
--> A5: At least, the graph of growth rate and the number of travelers had better be separated.</br></br>

##  Lessons learned approach</br></br>
1. Need to describe the graph title clearly
2. Need to describe some explanation.
3. Need to male 2 graphs if I need to show growth and popularity.
4. Need to put values.</br></br>


## Step5 : Build your solution</br></br>
1. [Original Data Source]("https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/media_root/document/Research_Fact-Sheet_US-Travel-and-Tourism-Overview.pdf")</br>
