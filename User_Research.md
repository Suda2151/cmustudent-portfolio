### Interview Contents and materials
The following link shows draft visualization that I used for the interview.<br>
[Iink to the draft graphs](/interview_draftGraph.md)


### a. The target audience I hope to reach with my story;
I targeted the person who likes to go trip using airlines. And I am targeting 2 types of audiences who like trip via airlines. One is my classmate in Telling Stories with Data class. Second is the person who has no experience for Telling Stories. Even for the audience who does not have any knowledge of Telling Story, I want to show my story to them how the current airline ranking consists of.

### b. My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview;
I selected three people. One is my classmate in Telling Stories with Data class. Second is the person who took the class in the previous semester. The third is the person who has no experience for Telling Stories. My story should be effective for not only the person who has an experience for Telling Story, but also the person who does not have any visualization experience. So, by expanding the target, I tried to get various frank opinions about my story. 

### c. Interview script;
In terms of the Interview, I asked three members. At first, I explained the storyboard from the beginning to the end and had a walkthrough for wireframe though it is under updating. The following point is what I asked them.<br>
1.	Whether the storytelling on storyboard does make sense. If not, what portion needs to be improved.
2.	Whether the wireframe(slide) shows understandable information. If not, what portion needs to be improved.
3.	Whether the current graph image is easy to understand. If not, what portion is bad. Please give me advice.
4.	Whether contents are requesting the audience to do something? If not, which portion is not clear for you from the audience perspective.<br><br>

Me: Hi! Here are my high-level wireframe and storyboard though I am still updating it. Would you mind giving me ideas behind what I made?<br>
Person 1 (No experience for visualization): Hi! Thank you for choosing me! The plan what you are going to show is very nice! The topic that you selected is a very interesting point for me. I understood that you are going to show whether there is any correlation between company revenue/passenger number ranking and customer popularity ranking, right?<br>

Me: Yes, I would like to show whether popularity links to passenger numbers directly to the audience. The background is I’m always using the same airlines without any thought, but I was wondering how other people choose airlines among many companies. And through the analysis, my criteria can be changed. And that is useful for not only me but also the audience to find more better airlines! For airline side also has a benefit if they might have a chance to have new customers who continue to select in the future. This type of information I want to share with the audience through my visualizations.<br>

Person 1 (No experience for visualization): OK! I ‘m not familiar with visualization, but let me give what I thought for the current slide. Firstly, As you mentioned to me, the background had better be described on the sheet. People might want to know the background of your choice of topic. And if you want to emphasize some portions, like numbers, values, etc, you should bold and bigger font rather than just writing with normal-sized font. And finally, some graphs are a little bit ambiguous for me to understand. For example at Popularity ranking, it is not easy to understand which is top-ranked and which is not. This had better be improved. Meanwhile, the topic is nice, I also want to attend the class to see your presentation.<br>

Me: Thanks, I will update what you suggested. In terms of graphs, I am still updating them. Once updated I will show you. Thank you for your time.<br>

Person 1: All the best! And I have never seen wireframe tool, power point seems to be more better. This is just my thought. Anyway good luck!<br>

Person 2 (Experienced): Hey! This topic looks very nice! I am also wondering what is the matter of people’s choice! For me, flight schedule and duration are the keys to select! The storyboard is so nice structure. Based on your explanation, the story that you explained to me sounds good. Meanwhile, if you can add, characteristic of the customer had better be considered. For instance, business persons and old parents do not have the same criteria. As you put on the graph, what character are you focusing on? If you can distinguish them, it would be better. Even if you do not have such data, you should define which type of customer are you referring to. And visualization should be more simple and clear. As you said you are under updating. Please keep on updating it. Good Luck!<br>

Me: Thank you. In terms of the characteristics of the customer, I could not find good data, but I will try to find it. At least I will add what type of customer now I am referring to.<br>

Person 2 (Experienced):  Sounds nice!  Please let me know the result of the presentation.<br>

Me: Sure!  Thanks<br>
________________________________________
Person 3 (ClassMate): It is nice to point to show. Your storyboard is good architecture. I’m just worried about whether that can be explained at 1-minute presentation. Information had better be summarized and cut accordingly to accommodate with 1-minute presentation. From a wireframe perspective, it is good. Toward the final presentation, this had better be considered. In terms of graphs, some explanation had better be added. By seeing the only graph, it is a little bit difficult to understand what the graph wants to say to the audience. As we talked, takeaway had better be more powerful.<br> 

Me: Thanks. Yes, toward the final presentation, I will brush up the volume. So far I will proceed based on the current wireframe. Yes, the Graph should be updated. I will follow that as well.<br>

### d. The findings from interviews
1.	Key point should be emphasized.
2.	Background explanation as storytelling.
3.	The quality of graphs needs to be improved.
4.	Source data need to be expanded. (Airline selection criteria differ from customer type between such as business person and old parents)
5.	Many slide pages.<br> 
### e. Changes I implemented to my sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.
1.	Modified slide structure. ( Made bigger font for emphasized points)
2.	Updated 1st slide to add quick background 
3.	Graph to be updated.
4.	Slide volume. (Some unnecessary items are removed)
5.	Additional Slide and storyboard are needed. Based on the discussion, it needs other factors about customer criteria. Those info need to be referred from top ranked airline such as Southwest or Alaska Airlines. Their specif factor could be the key point for their popularity. <br>
