# Overview - Aireline Assessment and Popularity

## Outline:

Finding an airline that you use might be a daunting task, especially if there are many indicators to select.
There are more than 1,400 airline companies all over the world. Even in the United States, there are around 19 major airline companies. How do we decide to use which airlines? What is our indicator in the case of selecting airlines? We have many ways to think about which airlines to use. Travel apps such as Expedia, word mouth among neighborhood and referring to company ranking from revenue or popularity perspectives, etc. In general, we can rely on company ranking which assesses companies' profit and the number of passengers. Meanwhile, we do have our own favorite airlines. How do we decide to which is favorite one? and how data contribute to airlines' ranking? Through the data analysis with visualization, I will provide my interpretation using the relationship between official ranking based on data and rumor such as CS ranking or word of mouth by several questionnaire sites.
