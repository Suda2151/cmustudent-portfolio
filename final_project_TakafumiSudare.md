# Overview - Airline Assessment and Popularity

## Outline:

Finding an airline that you use might be a daunting task, especially if there are many indicators to select.
There are more than 1,400 airline companies all over the world. Even in the United States, there are around 19 major airline companies. How do we decide to use which airlines? What is our indicator in the case of selecting airlines? We have many ways to think about which airlines to use. Travel apps such as Expedia, word mouth among neighborhood and referring to company ranking from revenue or popularity perspectives, etc. In general, we can rely on company ranking which assesses companies' profit and the number of passengers. Meanwhile, we do have our own favorite airlines. How do we decide to which is favorite one? and how data contribute to airlines' ranking? Through the data analysis with visualization, I will provide my interpretation using the relationship between official ranking based on data and rumor such as CS ranking or word of mouth by several questionnaire sites. <br>

Toward these analyses, I scraped the following data. Since the data in 2019 is not fully completed, I will use the actual data in 2018 for my analysis. In terms of ranking information, I scraped four sources to compare among them. And I also collect sample data from picked up Airlines. One is high ranked airlines such as Alaska, Jet Blue, and Delta, the other is low ranked such as American and Spirit. Based on the criteria to chose airlines, basically people refer to airfare. So just need to check and compare airlines by picking up planned flights for each country. This information will be used to analyze whether the ranking of airlines has a relationship to customer satisfaction and airfare which is the main purpose of the project as "public evaluation of a company is not linked to performance evaluation or CS rating?".

### Project Story
The project consists of four streams. 1) Actual data visualization and analysis, 2) Rating by customer analysis using several sources, 3) Both 1) and 2) comparison and analysis and 4) Conclusion with interpretation. 
Data are stored at several sites. All information needs to be collected and assessed accordingly. This takes a lot of time. Using some airlines to compare airfare is a good example to see what exact differences. And by using rating and ranking information, it can be checked whether there is any relationship between them.
In terms of comparison and analysis, the following analysis will be executed.
* Comparison and Assessment<br>
   - Ranking data(Passenger number) and Customer Satisfaction data<br>
   - Customer Satisfaction data between rating companies<br>
   - Criteria for choosing airlines and airline's sample data check<br>
   - Ranking data(Passenger number and Revenue) and Rating information<br> 

### Project Method and Medium
At the end of the project, I will be able to conclude if data visualization contributes to operating revenue of each airline with some interpretation based on the data. And By checking the example of travel plans through several airlines, we will be able to see some trends for each airline. That would be helpful to consider which airlines are you going to choose. In terms of visualization toward the final presentation, so far I am planning to use a box plot to compare the airfare for each airline. However, depending on the analysis, I will also use scattergrams to show the relations. Visualizations need to be simple and easy for the audience to understand even without much description. I will take care of that toward finalizing it.

The following is current sketches/visualizations that I am considering to make toward final presentation.<br>
