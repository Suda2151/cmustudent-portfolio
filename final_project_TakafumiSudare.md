# Overview - Aireline Assessment and Popularity

## Outline:

Finding an airline that you use might be a daunting task, especially if there are many indicators to select.
There are more than 1,400 airline companies all over the world. Even in the United States, there are around 19 major airline companies. How do we decide to use which airlines? What is our indicator in the case of selecting airlines? We have many ways to think about which airlines to use. Travel apps such as Expedia, word mouth among neighborhood and referring to company ranking from revenue or popularity perspectives, etc. In general, we can rely on company ranking which assesses companies' profit and the number of passengers. Meanwhile, we do have our own favorite airlines. How do we decide to which is favorite one? and how data contribute to airlines' ranking? Through the data analysis with visualization, I will provide my interpretation using the relationship between official ranking based on data and rumor such as CS ranking or word of mouth by several questionnaire sites. <br>

Toward these analyses, I scraped the following data. Since the data in 2019 is not fully completed, I will use the actual data in 2018 for my analysis. In terms of ranking information, I scraped four sources to compare among them. And I also collect sample data from picked up Airlines. One is high ranked airlines such as Alaska, Jet Blue, and Delta, the other is low ranked such as American and Spirit. Based on the criteria to chose airlines, basically people refer to airfare. So just need to check and compare airlines by picking up planned flights for each country. This information will be used to analyze whether the ranking of airlines has a relationship to customer satisfaction and airfare which is the main purpose of the project as "public evaluation of a company is not linked to performance evaluation or CS rating?".
