## User Research:
Please refer to the following link.<br>

## Wireframe(Presentation workflow):
Based on user research, there are some items that need to be revised.<br>
The following items were updated on the wireframe as Presentation.<br>
1. high-level summarization and background of my analysis are put on the first slide.
2. Emphasizing items are bold or made as bigger font accordingly.
3. Additional slides to cover the current explanation more strongly.
4. Key points and implications are put for each slide. (Still need to be updated more toward final presentation) <br><br>

The following is updated presentation workflow(Wireframe)<br>
