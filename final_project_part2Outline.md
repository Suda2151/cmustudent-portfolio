# Projcet Wireframes, Storyboard and User research

## User Research:
Please refer to the following link.<br>
The link includes a wireframe and a storyboard which I used at the interview as draft version.<br> 

[Iink to the User Research](/User_Research.md)<br>

At the interview, I used hand draw graphs in below link.
Just in case, I also attached the file below.<br>

## Wireframe(Presentation workflow):
Based on user research, there are some items that need to be revised.<br>
The following items were updated on the wireframe as Presentation.<br>
1. high-level summarization and background of my analysis are put on the first slide.
2. Emphasizing items are bold or made as bigger font accordingly.
3. Additional slides to cover the current explanation more strongly.
4. Key points and implications are put for each slide. (Still need to be updated more toward final presentation) <br><br>

The following is updated presentation workflow(Wireframe)<br>

## Storyboard:
In terms of storyboard, I updated a little bit based on user research.<br>
Background and key portions need to be described on the wireframe-side. To accommodate that, the storyboard also needs to be updated accordingly. Especially, to strengthen that the other factor is more reliable for customers than just airfare, I added stories with additional visualization.<br>
The following is the updated storyboard.<br>

## Visualization:
In terms of data rendering, my data sources are not sophisticated. It can not be used as it is. So I retrieved each source information, and make a graph based on that information. And sometimes for example at the ranking comparison, several sources need to be gathered and concatenated. That's why source information can not be used as rendering.<br>
Meanwhile, based on the interview, I updated the ranking graph using Tableau tool. The following updated visualized information.
The rest of them will be also crafted by some tools that I learned at the class.<br>
